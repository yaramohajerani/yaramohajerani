### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Washington in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Deparment.

I work at the intersection of data science and cryospheric sciences by utilizing machine learning and other techniques to get a better understanding of the Earth's glaciers from satellite remote sensing data.
